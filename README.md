# This is a simple expense tracker app build using html, css and JavaScript
    # In this project I learned how to update the DOM.
    # I learned how to edit and delete items from the DOM.
    # I learned how to filter items based on certain category.
    # I learned how to use select to update the DOM based on 
    a type of selection.
